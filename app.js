// 1a. Create a const variable called "mulan" and set the value to an object with the following properties (Property name of "title" with the value set to the following string `Mulan` & a property name of "main" with the value set to the following string `Fa Mulan`)

// 1b. Create a method in the mulan object called "quote" that RETURNS the following string `Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family!`

// 1c. Create another method called "storyline" that RETURNS the following string `The movie Mulan is about Fa Mulan.` by using the THIS keyword to access the values of "Mulan" & "Fa Mulan".

// 2b. Create a method in the tangled object called "quote" that RETURNS the following string `I can't believe I did this! I can't believe I did this! I have to go home! I am never going back! I'm a horrible daughter! BEST DAY EVER!`

// 2c. Create another method called "storyline" that RETURNS the following string `The movie Tangled is about Rapunzel.` by using the THIS keyword to access the values of "Tangled" and "Rapunzel"

this.main=m;

}
// 4c. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object that matches the mulan object from question 1 by passing in the appropriate values and set the new created object to a const variable called mulan
const mulan2= new DM(`Mulan`, `Fa Mulan`); 
console.log(mulan2);
console.log(mulan2.storyline());

// 4d. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object that matches the tangled object from question 2 by passing in the appropriate values and set the new created object to a const variable called tangled2
const tangled2= new DM (`Tangled`, `Rapunzel`); 
console.log(tangled2);

// 4f. Using the DM class name, run the loveDisneyMovies method (NOTE: You will need to put it in a console log if you want to see the returned value display in terminal)
console.log(DM.loveDisneyMovies());

// 5a. Using the EXTENDS keyword create a subclass of the DM class called "DMCast"
// 5b. Inside the DMCast subclass create a constructor that takes the following parameters ("title", "main", & "cast").
// 5c. Inside the constructor use the SUPER keyword to get the "title" & "main" properties from the DM parent class. Also, set the cast parameter as a new property (HINT: You will need to use the THIS keyword)

// 5d. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object by passing in the same values from question 4c. However, pass in the following object for the value of the "cast" property {mulan: `Ming-Na Wen`, mushu: `Eddie Murphy`, shang: `BD Wong`, theEmperor: `Pat Morita`} and set the entire new created object to a const variable called mulan3



// 5e. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object by passing in the same values from question 4d. However, pass in the following object for the value of the "cast" property {rapunzel: `Mandy Moore`, flynnRider: `Zachary Levi`, motherGothel: `Donna Murphy`} and set the entire new created object to a const variable called rapunzel3
